A Jupyter notebook supporting our manuscript, _Size-Resolved Shape Evolution in Inorganic Nanocrystals Captured via High-Throughput Deep Learning-Driven Statistical Characterization_ (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.4c09312).

The relevant dataset, including the training images and labeled dataset with pixel sizes ranging from 67 to 86 pm, as well as the testing dataset of TEM images and segmentation results for each Co3O4 nanocrystal sample, is available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/14927582.
